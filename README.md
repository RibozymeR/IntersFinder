# IntersFinder

Small program to find possible points of intersections of certain lines for my Master's Thesis.

Program can be run and compiled with Java. Parameters currently have to be changed in sourcecode; this was sufficient for my purposes, but might be nice to change in the future. Same holds for the current brute-force searching algorithm.
